        <p>Pines is a MVC based PHP framework, designed to help produce
        complex web applications rapidly. It is a full featured application
        framework, which provides features not only unique to Pines as a
        framework, but never before seen in PHP. Pines is designed with the
        developer in mind. This is reflected in the history of Pines.</p>

        <p>Pines' goal as a framework is to provide the developer with a
        set of tools, which simplify the development of complex applications
        and allow administrators to easily and quickly set up complex, secure
        installations. One of the key aspects considered in Pines development
        is customization. Pines has a long history of being customized for all
        sorts of use, and that history has brought Pines some important tools.
        The SciActive maintained configurator component, com_configure, is a
        perfect example of Pines' obsession with customization, allowing the
        administrator to provide different configuration based on users,
        groups, and even dependency sets.</p>

        <p>Pines strives to also provide this level of customization to its
        developers. Many of the features available in Pines are provided
        through system services, which can be implemented in many different
        ways. For example, the entity manager, used to provide data storage
        and retrieval, can use any number of different backends. Because Pines
        defines a standard way of interacting with these system services,
        developers can design their components once, and have it work with any
        implementation of these system services. Developers can also extend
        components to add features not available by default. For example, the
        official user manager adds access control features to the entity
        manager, which by default, has no considerations for users or groups.
        Amazingly, this extension to the entity manager is accomplished
        without altering any of its code. The user manager uses method hooking
        to alter the functionality of the entity manager. This level of
        flexibility allows developers to create complex, scalable applications
        with ease.</p>
