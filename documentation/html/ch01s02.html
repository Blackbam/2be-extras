        <p>Pines was started in the Fall of 2008 by myself, Hunter Perrin.
        While taking my first PHP class, along with a French I class, I
        developed a small PHP application to allow the collaborative editing
        of a play script. The application was used for my French class, then
        stowed away. Several months after that, I started a new job, working
        as a web designer. There, they requested me to find an application
        capable of sending newsletters to their clients. I dug up the old
        application, and adapted it to send emails. This incarnation was
        called Dandelion, and released under the GNU Affero GPL.</p>

        <p>After a year there, I took a new position. They had several new
        ideas for web applications, which I slowly started building using
        Dandelion. When the project started to really resemble a framework,
        not just an application, we renamed it to Pines. Problem after problem
        would arise, and solution after solution would be built. All atop the
        Pines framework. Every feature in Pines has come from the real need of
        a business environment. Pines has seen many redesigns, and it barely
        resembles the early application.</p>

        <p>Now Pines is a solid, well tested, and well documented
        framework, suitable for building high demand enterprise
        applications.</p>
